  -d '{
    "selectedService": {"title": "Hot Stone Massage", "duration": "90 min", "price": "$150"},

## 🔑 **Why Email Password in .env?**

### **The Technical Reason**:
Gmail doesn't allow regular passwords for third-party apps for security. You need:

1. **2-Factor Authentication** enabled
2. **App-Specific Password** generated (16 characters like `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
3. **Environment variables** to keep it secure

### **The Security Reason**:
```
❌ WRONG: Put password in code
✅ RIGHT: Put password in .env file

Why?
• .env files are NOT committed to git (.gitignore)
• Different passwords for dev/staging/production  
• Easy to rotate passwords without code changes
• Industry security standard
```

### **The Business Reason**:
Without email configuration:
- ❌ Contact forms work but don't send emails
- ❌ Bookings work but customers get no confirmation
- ❌ Newsletter signup works but no welcome email
- ❌ You miss potential business opportunities

With email configured:
- ✅ Professional customer communication
- ✅ Automatic booking confirmations
- ✅ No missed inquiries
- ✅ Real business tool, not just a demo
